# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Angular Web Page with Angular Material

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a simple web page using the latest version of Angular (Version 19) and Angular Material. The web page will serve as a minimal viable product (MVP) featuring a thank you note, a background GIF, background music, and a gallery of five pictures.

## Objectives
- Create a visually appealing web page that showcases the capabilities of Angular and Angular Material.
- Implement essential features without overcomplicating the design or functionality.
- Ensure the web page is responsive and accessible.

## Key Features
1. **Header Section**
   - A prominent header displaying a thank you note.
   - Use Angular Material typography for consistent styling.

2. **Background**
   - A GIF image that fills the background behind the header.
   - Ensure the GIF is optimized for web use to minimize loading times.

3. **Background Music**
   - Implement audio playback that starts automatically when the page loads.
   - Provide controls for users to play/pause the music.

4. **Gallery Section**
   - A gallery displaying five images.
   - Use Angular Material card components for each image to enhance UI consistency and aesthetics.
   - Ensure images are responsive and maintain aspect ratios.

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Angular (latest version 19)
- **UI Library**: Angular Material
- **Development Tools**:
  - Node.js and npm for package management.
  - Angular CLI for project setup and component generation.

## Design Considerations
- **Theming**: Utilize Angular Materialâ€™s theming capabilities to create a cohesive color palette that aligns with the project's branding.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Responsive Design**: Use CSS Flexbox or Grid layouts to ensure the webpage looks good on various screen sizes.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Development Environment
- Install Node.js (latest LTS version recommended) and Angular CLI globally:

  npm install -g @angular/cli

- Create a new Angular project using:

  ng new project-name --routing --style=scss

- Navigate into your project directory:

  cd project-name

- Install Angular Material with:

  ng add @angular/material


### 2. Create Components
- Generate components for the header, gallery, and main content using Angular CLI commands:

  ng generate component header
  ng generate component gallery
  ng generate component main-content # Optional: For better structure


### 3. Build Header Component
- Add HTML for the thank you note in `header.component.html`:
  
    <h1 mat-header>{{ thankYouNote }}</h1>
  
- Style it using Angular Material typography classes in `header.component.scss`.

### 4. Implement Background GIF and Music
- Use CSS to set the background image in `styles.scss` or `main-content.component.scss`:
  
    body {
      background-image: url('path/to/your/background.gif');
      background-size: cover;
      background-position: center;
    }
  
- Include an HTML `<audio>` element in `main-content.component.html` with controls:
  
    <audio controls autoplay>
      <source src="path/to/your/music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
  

### 5. Build Gallery Component
- Use Angular Material card components to display images in a grid layout within `gallery.component.html`:
  
    <mat-card *ngFor="let image of images">
      <img mat-card-image [src]="image.src" [alt]="image.alt">
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>{{ image.description }}</p>
      </mat-card-content>
    </mat-card>
  
- Ensure images are loaded efficiently by using lazy loading techniques if necessary.

### 6. Testing
- Conduct testing across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
- Perform accessibility checks using tools like Lighthouse or axe-core:
  
    npm install -g lighthouse # For running Lighthouse audits
  

### 7. Deployment
- Choose a hosting solution (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify).
- Build the project for production using:
  
    ng build --prod --output-path=dist/project-name --base-href /
  
- Follow specific hosting instructions to deploy your application.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Setup environment, create components, implement header.
- **Week 2**: Add background GIF and music functionality, build gallery component.
- **Week 3**: Testing and debugging, prepare for deployment.

## Conclusion
This PRD outlines the essential features, technical requirements, design considerations, implementation steps, and timeline necessary to develop a simple yet effective web page using Angular and Angular Material. By following this plan, you can create an MVP that showcases your project's core objectives without unnecessary complexity.

### Enhancements Made:
1. **Detailed Steps**: Expanded on each implementation step with code snippets where applicable.
2. **Best Practices**: Included recommendations for setting up Node.js and Angular CLI properly.
3. **Accessibility Checks**: Added instructions on how to use Lighthouse for testing accessibility.
4. **Lazy Loading Consideration**: Suggested lazy loading techniques for images in the gallery.
5. **Styling Recommendations**: Provided specific SCSS examples for styling components.
